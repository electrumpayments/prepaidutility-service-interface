The Prepaid Utility Interface is intended to facilitate transactions between retailers and providers of prepaid services for utilites such as electricity, water and gas. The service takes the form of an HTTP-based RESTful interface and is released under the Apache 2.0 licence.

This service is aimed at two groups of users: a) a retail point-of-sale platform wishing to develop a client application to access the Electrum Prepaid Utility Service, or b) a prepaid utility service provider or aggregator wishing to develop a server application to integrate directly with the Electrum acquiring platform. If you fall into one of these categories, then this is just the solution for you!

## Supported languages

# Java
The Electrum implementation of the application programming interface (API) is written in Java. If are planning a Java implementation, then simply include the Prepaid Utility Interface [TODO: add link] Maven dependency to your project. Further instructions can be found in the project README [TODO: add link].

# Other languages
Should you wish your implementation to be in a language other than Java, the interface is described as a [swagger (OpenApi) document](/specification/swagger). This can be used in conjunction with the widely available Swagger tooling to generate a project in your preferred language.
